# TLabVehiclePhysics
An open source wheel collider sample project  
This project uses URP, but TLabVihiclePhysics itself can also be used in the built-in render pipeline

## Note
The repository is currently undergoing a destructive update, and in the process I updated the behavior of the car, so upload it once. The mod-compatible code has now been removed, so if you want to refer to it, please refer to the previous commitsgit  
The following is the commit ID before the destructive update ``` commit 61e21c8df167bc6b5320b4f8f5b2b4efc7cc58c2 ```
